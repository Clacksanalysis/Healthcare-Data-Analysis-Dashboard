# 🏥  Healthcare Data Analysis Dashboard

## 📌 Overview / Objective

This project analyzes a dataset of 55,500 unique patient records from 10 major hospitals across the U.S. The goal is to uncover patterns in hospital performance, patient demographics, insurance billing, and treatment outcomes. By leveraging Power BI, the analysis delivers meaningful insights to support healthcare decision-making, cost optimization, and patient care improvement.

## ❓ Key Questions / Goals

1. Which hospitals have the highest billing averages and patient volumes?
2. How does patient distribution vary by state and over time?
3. What are the most common diagnoses and medications?
4. How do insurance types impact billing and stay duration?
5. Are there seasonal or demographic trends in hospital visits?

## 🔍 Methodology

1. Cleaned and loaded the dataset into Power BI  
2. Created calculated columns for age groups and cost metrics  
3. Built dashboards with interactive filters and slicers  
4. Conducted drill-down analysis across demographics, insurance, and hospital performance  
5. Visualized patterns using line charts, bar graphs, and maps

## 📊 Insights / Findings

### Hospital Performance
- Top billing hospitals: **Cedars-Sinai**, **Mayo Clinic**, and **Massachusetts General Hospital**
- Highest test volumes: **Houston Methodist**
- Peak patient visits in **June–July**; lowest in **February**

### Cost & Insurance
- Average billing: **$25.5K**, Length of stay: **15.5 days**
- Top conditions: **Cancer** (highest cost), **Diabetes**, **Hypertension**
- Most common meds: **Paracetamol**, **Lipitor**

### Demographics

## 📈 Visualizations

Dashboards are divided into:

1. **Hospital Insight**: Top hospitals, patient counts, test volumes, seasonal trends
2. **Cost & Insurance Analysis**: Billing, stay duration, conditions vs cost, insurance providers
3. **Patient Demographics**: Age/gender groups, admission types, diagnosis prevalence

*(Screenshots  and Pdf of dashboards are included in the repository)*

## ✅ Conclusion / Recommendations

- Billing costs are consistently high across top-performing hospitals
- June–July require higher resource allocation due to patient surges
- Insurers contribute nearly equally, but elderly patients dominate usage
- Prioritize preventive care for high-cost conditions like **Cancer** and **Hypertension**
- Optimize stay duration for emergency cases to reduce healthcare burden
